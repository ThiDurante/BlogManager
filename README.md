# Blog Manager

An api to manage users/posts on a Blog, made with Node, express, mysql and sequelize.

Project was part of Trybe's Course

## Installation and use

This project run on Docker! So the easiest way would be to download the project, access its folder and do:

```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  docker exec -it blogs_api bash
  # inside the container's terminal:
  npm i
  npm run drop && npm run prestart && npm run seed & npm run debug
```

And the API will be working on port 3000 of the localhost!

From here you can use postman || insomnia || thunderclient to send requests and see it working!

## Screenshots

I use a pattern for commits that makes them easily readable and faster to understand changes that were made!
